I cleaned these files up some but it's tough when they were already committed.  The Solution folder has all the parts of the assignment.  

In addition to writing the code I used data modeling to inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables (file ERD.png), data engineering to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files (schema.sql) and data analysis to learn more about the employees (queries.sql).
